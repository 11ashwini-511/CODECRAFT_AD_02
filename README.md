To-Do List App 

The command-line To-Do List app is a simple, text-based application designed to help users manage their daily tasks. It provides a minimalist approach to task management by allowing users to add, view, edit, delete, and clear tasks through straightforward interactions.
Features of the To-Do List App

1. Display Tasks: The app displays all the tasks currently in the to-do list. Each task is assigned a unique number, making it easy for the user to manage their list. If no tasks are available, the app informs the user of an empty list.


2. Add Task: Users can add new tasks to the list by typing their descriptions. The task is appended to the end of the list, and the app confirms the addition.


3. Edit Task: This feature allows users to modify an existing task. By entering the task's number, users can update its description. If an invalid number is provided, the app handles the error gracefully and prompts the user again.


4. Delete Task: Users can remove specific tasks from the list by selecting their corresponding number. The app confirms the successful deletion of the task.


6. Clear All Tasks: For those who wish to start fresh, the app offers an option to clear the entire to-do list after user confirmation.


7. Exit: The app provides an option to terminate the program, ensuring a clean exit from the command-line interface.


How the App Works

The app starts by presenting a menu to the user. The menu includes all available options, from displaying tasks to exiting the application. The user selects an option by entering the corresponding number. The app then performs the requested action, whether itâ€™s adding a new task, editing an existing one, or clearing the list.
